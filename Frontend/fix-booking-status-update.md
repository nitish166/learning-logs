# Learning Log: Fixing Booking Status Update Issue in BookingHistory.jsx

## ðŸ“… Date: 16 April 2025

---

## 1. Problem Statement
The booking status in the `BookingHistory.jsx` page was showing as `pending` even though the payment was completed and the status in the payment table was updated to `success`.

---

## 2. Key Issues Identified
1. **Booking Status Not Updated**:
   - When a payment was completed, the booking status in the `Booking` table was not updated to `confirmed`.

2. **Frontend Fetching Outdated Data**:
   - The `/bookings/user` endpoint was returning the `pending` status because the booking status was not updated in the backend.

3. **Missing Logic in Payment Confirmation**:
   - The backend logic for updating the booking status after payment confirmation was missing.

---

## 3. Solutions Implemented

### **Solution 1: Update Booking Status in Backend**
- Added a function `updateBookingStatus` in the backend to update the booking status to `confirmed` when the payment status is set to `success`.

#### **Code Example**
```typescript
private static async updateBookingStatus(paymentId: string): Promise<void> {
  const payment = await Payment.findById(paymentId);
  if (payment && payment.status === 'success') {
    await Booking.findByIdAndUpdate(payment.bookingId, { status: 'confirmed' });
  }
}
```

Called this function in the handleCapturedPayment method after updating the payment status to success.

### **Solution 2: Handle Captured Payment**
- Updated the `handleCapturedPayment` method to set the payment status to `success` and call the `updateBookingStatus` function.

#### **Code Example**
```typescript
private static async handleCapturedPayment(payment: IPayment, orderId: string): Promise<void> {
  try {
    if (payment.status !== TripooStatus.SUCCESS) {
      payment.status = TripooStatus.SUCCESS;
      await payment.save();

      // Update booking status to "confirmed"
      await PaymentController.updateBookingStatus(payment._id);

      console.log('[PaymentController] Payment successful and booking confirmed:', { 
        orderId,
        bookingId: payment.bookingId,
        amount: payment.amount 
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('[PaymentController] Error handling captured payment:', error);
  }
}
```

### **Solution 3: Frontend Updates**

#### **UI Enhancements**
- Updated the `getStatusColor` method to handle the `confirmed` status. Previously, it was incorrectly mapped to `completed`.

#### **Code Example**
```javascript
function getStatusColor(status) {
    switch (status) {
        case 'pending':
            return 'yellow';
        case 'confirmed':
            return 'green';
        case 'cancelled':
            return 'red';
        default:
            return 'gray';
    }
}
```

## 4. Final Implementation

### **Backend**
1. Added the `updateBookingStatus` function to update the booking status to `confirmed` after payment confirmation.
2. Integrated the function into the `handleCapturedPayment` method to ensure the booking status is updated consistently.

### **Frontend**
1. Ensured the `fetchBookings` function retrieves fresh data from the `/bookings/user` endpoint to reflect the latest booking status.
2. Added the `handleCancelBooking` function to allow users to cancel bookings directly from the UI.

---

## 5. Key Learnings

### **Backend-Frontend Synchronization**
- The backend must ensure that all related entities (e.g., Payment and Booking) are updated consistently to reflect the correct status in the frontend.

### **Importance of Fresh Data**
- The frontend should always fetch fresh data after any updates to ensure the UI reflects the latest state.

### **Error Handling**
- Proper error handling in both the backend and frontend is crucial to provide a smooth user experience.

### **Modular Backend Logic**
- Breaking down backend logic into smaller, reusable functions (e.g., `updateBookingStatus`) makes the code easier to maintain and debug.

## 6. Future Improvements

1. **Webhooks for Real-Time Updates**:
     - Implement webhooks to notify the backend of payment status changes in real-time and update the booking status immediately.

2. **Optimized Data Fetching**:
     - Use state management libraries (e.g., Redux or React Query) to optimize data fetching and reduce redundant API calls.

3. **Enhanced UI Feedback**:
     - Add loading indicators or skeleton screens to improve the user experience while fetching or updating data.

---

## 7. Final Outcome

- The booking status is now updated to `confirmed` after payment confirmation.
- The `/bookings/user` endpoint returns the correct status (`confirmed` or `cancelled`).
- The UI reflects the updated booking status correctly in the `BookingHistory.jsx` page.
