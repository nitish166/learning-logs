## 1. **Manual Setup** (Vanilla React + Custom Config)

You can create a React project from scratch by manually setting up tools.

### **Key Components:**

- **React & ReactDOM** – Core libraries
- **Babel** – Transpiles JSX/ES6+ to browser-compatible JavaScript
- **Webpack** – Bundles JS, CSS, assets, etc.
- **Bundler (e.g., Parcel)** – Alternate simpler bundling option

### **Pros:**

- Full control and deep understanding
- Highly customizable for special needs

### **Cons:**

- Tedious to set up
- Error-prone for beginners
- Not recommended for quick prototypes

---

## 2. **Create React App (CRA)**

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

CRA generates a full React boilerplate with config.

### **Pros:**

- Quick start with zero config
- Includes Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.
- Popular and well-supported

### **Cons:**

- Hard to customize without ejecting (removes the abstraction to allow full customization but makes future updates harder)
- Heavy bundle size
- Slower dev builds compared to modern tools

---

## 3. **Using Vite (✅ Recommended for Modern Development)**

Vite uses ESBuild, a modern JavaScript bundler and minifier written in Go, under the hood for super-fast dev experience.

### **Pros:**

- Lightning-fast HMR and builds
- Minimal config
- Supports multiple frameworks

### **Cons:**

- Plugins and community support are still catching up (but rapidly maturing)
- Slight learning curve if migrating from CRA

## ✅ Best Practices for React Project Setup

- Clean up unused CRA files (like logos/test files)
- Use **Vite** for performance and ease
- Try **manual setup** to understand internals
- Use **CRA** for legacy projects or large team compatibility
